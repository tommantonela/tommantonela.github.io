&lt;p&gt;This dataset presents a collection of the official local governments&amp;rsquo; Twitter activity in Buenos Aires Province in Argentina. The collection is entirely in Spanish and was built by crawling each local government&#39;s social media accounts and the reactions it received. The collection focuses on the content-based relations established between the local government authorities and the citizens, instead of on the follower/followee relationship.
The dataset is useful for studying how government entities manifest themselves in social media and their different ways of transmitting information; and how citizens interact and express their commitment to the government entities.
The collection includes the account activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Data was collected using the Twitter API and will be periodically updated.&lt;/p&gt;
