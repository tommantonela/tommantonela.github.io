  abstract = {Sparse-matrix operations are commonplace in computational science, and novel solutions for speeding-up them are essential for numerous applications. SMArtOp is a software for efficiently dividing and distributing the processing of large-scale sparse-matrix arithmetic operations. This software relies on both the distinctive characteristics of each type of arithmetic operation and the particular matrices involved to split the operations into parallel and simpler tasks. Experimental evaluation showed the speeding-up and resource consumption advantages of the proposed software, in comparison to other linear-algebra libraries.},
