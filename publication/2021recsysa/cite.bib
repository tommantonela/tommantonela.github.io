abstract = { Recommender systems play a central role in online information consumption and user
decision-making by leveraging user-generated information at scale to assist users
in finding relevant information and establishing new social relationships. Just as
recommendation techniques have become powerful tools that are inserted in most social
platforms, they could also involuntarily spread unwanted content and other types of
online harms. The same fundamental concepts on which these techniques rely make them
facilitators of such unwanted diffusion. To increase the user-perceived quality of
recommender systems and mitigating the negative effects of the multiple forms of online
harms, it is essential to provide recommender systems with harm-aware mechanisms.
To further research in this direction, this Second edition of the Workshop on Online
Misinformation- and Harm-Aware Recommender Systems (OHARS 2021) aimed at fostering
research in recommender systems that can mitigate the negative effects of online harms
by fostering the recommendation of safe content and trustworthy users, with a special
interest in research tackling the negative effects of the propagation of harmful content
referring to the COVID-19 crisis. },
