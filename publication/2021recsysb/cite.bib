abstract = { Recommender systems serve as mediators of information consumption and propagation.
In this role, these systems have been recently criticized for introducing biases and
promoting the creation of echo chambers and filter bubbles, thus lowering the diversity
of both content and potential new social relations users are exposed to. Some of these
issues are a consequence of the fundamental concepts on which recommender systems
are based on. Assumptions like the homophily principle might lead users to content
that they already like or friends they already know, which can be na\"{\i}ve in the era
of ideological uniformity and fake news. A significant challenge in this context is
how to effectively learn the dynamic representations of users based on the content
they share and their echo chamber or community interactions to recommend potentially
relevant and diverse friends from outside the network of influence of the users’ echo
chamber. To address this, we devise FRediECH (a Friend RecommenDer for breakIng Echo
CHambers), an echo chamber-aware friend recommendation approach that learns users
and echo chamber representations from the shared content and past users’ and communities’
interactions. Comprehensive evaluations over Twitter data showed that our approach
achieved better performance (in terms of relevance and novelty) than state-of-the-art
alternatives, validating its effectiveness. },
