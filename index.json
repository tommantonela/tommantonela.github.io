Architectural smells are typical symptoms of such problems, and several of these smells are related to undesired dependencies among modules. The early detection of these smells is important for developers, so they can plan ahead for maintenance or refactoring efforts, thus preventing system degradation. Social Network Analysis (SNA) refers to a strategy for investigating social structures using network and graph theories. The link prediction problem adapts SNA techniques for studying to what extent the evolution of a network can be modelled by using features intrinsic to the network. Since the module structure can be regarded as a network, i.e., a dependency graph, we can leverage on network features to analyse the dynamics of such structure. In this talk, we will explore how link prediction and machine learning techniques could help anticipate architectural smells in future system versions. We will start with the basics of predicting future dependencies, up to the application of time forecasting and machine learning models for predicting the appearance of new architectural smells. Particularly, we will focus on two well-known dependency-related smells, cyclic dependencies and hub-like dependency.

The development of digital technologies, the expansion of the Internet and the growth of social networks have generated profound changes in political forms at a global level, modifying the bases of citizen participation. These new technologies have been established as a new way to channel and facilitate citizen participation in a given territory, offering new communication tools with government entities and their authorities. EParticipation involves the use of the information and communication technologies, mainly Internet, as the means of participation in democratic and consultative social processes. The goal of eParticipation is to support active citizenship with the latest technological developments, increasing access and the possibility of participating, and promoting a government that is open and close to citizens. Considering that democratic systems favour the interests of large groups of citizens, the more voices supporting a political proposal, the greater their chances of success. However, achieving effective citizen participation is a challenge, given that the simple fact of having access to online services does not imply the willingness of citizens to participate. In this context, social media sites could have a preponderant role in terms of citizen participation, making individuals not only feel that they have access to the information directly and permanently, but also the right to be involved in the public discourse and decisions. Consequently, it is necessary to carry out studies for determining the current status and perspectives of citizen participation in the context of social media. Thereby, this project aims to study and characterize the relationship between digital citizens and government entities in social media, in the context of eParticipation, to enable the definition of practices and strategies that lead to the efficient use of social media for communication between public institutions and citizens.\n","date":1567728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567728000,"objectID":"0572368d41fd1e63c346bbbe7b3b047b","permalink":"/project/digital-citizenship/","publishdate":"2019-09-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/digital-citizenship/","section":"project","summary":"The Role of Social Media in e-Participation in Argentina","tags":["eGovernment","Citizens","Smart Cities","Social Media"],"title":"Digital Citizens","type":"project"},{"authors":["Antonela Tommasel","Daniela Godoy","Andres Diaz Pace"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"6be3f342ae26668b2f93924eaddb706f","permalink":"/publication/2019sts/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019sts/","section":"publication","summary":"El objeto de estudio de este trabajo es la Provincia de Buenos Aires en Argentina, la cual concentra la mayor cantidad de ciudadanos del pais, y por lo tanto presenta la mayor necesidad de comunicacion con ellos.","tags":["Ciudadanos Digitales","Medios Sociales","e-Participacion","Gobiernos Locales","Gobierno Abierto"],"title":"Ciudadanos Digitales: explorando el rol de los medios sociales de comunicacion en la e-Participacion","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Sen4Smells is tool for prioritizing architecture-sensitive smells based on a technical debt index (e.g., ADI, SDI, etc.) Sen4Smells is licenced under the Apache License V2.0.\nThe main functionality of the Sen4Smells is providing assistence to engineers for interpretating Technical Debt metrics in terms problematic Architectural Smells and system packages.\nSen4Smells is able to perform a sensitivity analysis for a collection of system values provided by a predetermined debt index. Our approach relies on two building blocks:\n The adaptation of an existing SA method to AS-based debt indices. A decomposition strategy for dealing with the index at different granularity levels.  By leveraging on Architectural Smells, the goal of the Sensitivity Analysis is to understand how variations in the Technical Debt can be attributed to variations in features of system elements. To do so, the sensitivity analysis performs a screening of the multiple variables affecting the index over time, and returns the most sensitive ones (i.e., key elements) to the engineer (tool user). The inputs for this analysis are: a set of previous system versions, the formula for computing a particular Technical Debt, and the granularity level for the variables (e.g., smell types, individual smells, or packages).\nThe tool is designed as pipeline, in which existing modules for detecting smells and computing metrics from the source code can be configured.

Besides fostering social connections between persons, social networks also represent the ideal environment for undesirable phenomena, such as the dissemination of unwanted or aggressive content, misinformation and fake news, which all affect the individuals as well as the society as a whole. Thereby, in the last few years, the research on misinformation has received increasing attention. Nonetheless, even though some computational solutions have been presented, the lack of a common ground and public datasets has become one of the major barriers. Not only datasets are rare, but also, they are mostly limited to only the actual shared text, neglecting the importance of other features, such as social content and temporal information. In this scenario, this project proposes the creation of a publicly available dataset, comprising multi-sourced data and including diverse features related not only to the textual and multimedia content, but also to the social context of news and their temporal information. This dataset would not only allow tackling the task of fake news detection, but also studying their evolution, which, in turn, can foster the development of mitigation and debunking techniques.\n","date":1566864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566864000,"objectID":"34337dccfe11827ac7b26bd735d26aec","permalink":"/project/faking-it/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/faking-it/","section":"project","summary":"Faking It!

Architectural smells are typical symptoms of such problems, and several of these smells are related to undesired dependencies among modules. The early detection of these smells is important for developers, so they can plan ahead for maintenance or refactoring efforts, thus preventing system degradation. Social Network Analysis (SNA) refers to a strategy for investigating social structures using network and graph theories. The link prediction problem adapts SNA techniques for studying to what extent the evolution of a network can be modelled by using features intrinsic to the network. Since the module structure can be regarded as a network, i.e., a dependency graph, we can leverage on network features to analyse the dynamics of such structure. In this talk, we will explore how link prediction and machine learning techniques could help anticipate architectural smells in future system versions. We will start with the basics of predicting future dependencies, up to the application of time forecasting and machine learning models for predicting the appearance of new architectural smells. Particularly, we will focus on two well-known dependency-related smells, cyclic dependencies and hub-like dependency. Finally, we will discuss some open issues and potential extensions.\n ","date":1536242400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536242400,"objectID":"9fc19630cbe6736347978a66e0af7af2","permalink":"/talk/milano2018/","publishdate":"2018-09-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/milano2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Architectural Smells \u0026 Machine Learning mash-up","tags":["Machine Learning","Software Architecture","Architectural Smells"],"title":"Keeping one-step ahead of Architectural Smells: A Machine Learning application","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Andres Diaz-Pace","Antonela Tommasel","Daniela Godoy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"68fee824a1c1c2f1ff57e39f69a0fbaa","permalink":"/publication/2018scam/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018scam/","section":"publication","summary":"We explore a forward-looking approach that is able to infer groups of likely module dependencies that can anticipate architectural smells in a future system version.","tags":["Module Dependencies","Architectural Smells","Link Prediction","Cycles","Machine Learning"],"title":"[Research Paper] Towards Anticipation of Architectural Smells Using Link Prediction Techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonela Tommasel","Daniela Godoy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"f09f2b383b73e1a8682147d21f40b4b6","permalink":"/publication/2018inffus/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018inffus/","section":"publication","summary":"This work presents an online feature selection technique for high-dimensional data based on the integration of two information sources, social and content-based, for the real-time classification of short-text streams coming from social media.","tags":["Online feature selection","Classification","Micro-blogging communities"],"title":"A Social-aware online short-text feature selection technique for social media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andres Diaz Pace","Antonela Tommasel","Daniela Godoy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"f9b79f81e19bffaeb4af15eca0860462","permalink":"/publication/2018icsa/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018icsa/","section":"publication","summary":"In this work, we investigate whether module dependencies can be predicted (before they actually appear).","tags":["Dependencies","Design Problems","Link Prediction"],"title":"Can Network Analysis Techniques Help to Predict Design Dependencies?

The continuous growing and pervasive use of social media offers interesting research opportunities for analysing the behaviour and interactions of users. Nowadays, interactions are not only limited to social relations, but also to reading and writing activities. Thus, multiple and complementary information sources are available for characterising users and their activities. One task that could benefit from the integration of those multiple sources is community detection. However, most techniques disregard the effect of information aggregation and continue to focus only on one aspect: the topological structure of networks. This paper focuses on how to integrate social and content-based information originated in social networks for improving the quality of the detected communities. A technique for integrating both the multiple information sources and the semantics conveyed by asymmetric relations is proposed and extensively evaluated on two real-world datasets. Experimental evaluation confirmed the differentiated impact that each information source has on the quality of the detected communities, and shed some light on how to improve such quality by combining both social and content-based information.","tags":["Community Detection","Social Networks","Multi-view Learning","Social Graph","Community Structure"],"title":"Multi-view community detection with heterogeneous information from social media data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Manuel Rodriguez","Alejandro Zunino","Antonela Tommasel","Cristian Mateos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"c751af153f4c9718a0da15ecdbc2f368","permalink":"/publication/2018igi/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018igi/","section":"publication","summary":"This chapter aims at predicting mobile devices' battery charge, whether it is plugged to A/C, and screen and WiFi state.","tags":[],"title":"Recurrent Neural Networks for Predicting Mobile Device State","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonela Tommasel","Juan Manuel Rodriguez","Daniela Godoy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"dfd21507e02c0d0f81095de2262f7839","permalink":"/publication/2018coling/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018coling/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents the Isistanitos's approach for detecting aggressive content in multiple social media sites.","tags":[],"title":"Textual aggression detection through deep learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonela Tommasel","Daniela Godoy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"88bd2d9ef06a00e4a3e18dcbd90cd1c9","permalink":"/publication/2017clei/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017clei/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper aims at providing some insights on how to integrate the multiple and heterogeneous social media information sources characterising user activities and behaviour to optimise the quality of found communities.

media platforms to recommend content to its users through features such as �whom to follow� or personalised content. It has been shown however that social media platforms also spread harmful contents that have proven problematic. This project aims to detect and mitigate content flagged as online harm, which includes hate speech and misinformation. These problematic issues in social media have led to mental health issues owing to hate speech messages, as well as a disruption of the democratic system due to the diffusion of misinformation. Identification of harmful content online has however proven difficult, with not only the scientific community but also social media platforms and governments worldwide calling for support to develop effective methods.\nThis project aims to develop novel recommendation algorithms for social media that prevent the amplification of online harms including misinformation and hate speech. Sources that are likely to generate this sort of online harm will be identified and will be flagged prior to making decisions with the recommender system. The algorithms will need to consider three main aspects: (1) detection of misinformation and abusive language from a multilingual perspective, for English and Spanish (2) incorporation of the notion of content toxicity, and accounts that promote it, into the inner components of recommendation algorithms (3) definition of mechanisms to counteract user exposure to online harm, such as the addition of features (such as provenance and context of information) that will increase user-awareness and help foster an informed decision making. The algorithms will also need to prevent potential biases inherent to traditional recommender systems, such as popularity and homogeneity.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3c4acec2c8574251aa414e8fcac5df86","permalink":"/project/royal-society/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/royal-society/","section":"project","summary":"Online Harm-Aware Recommender System","tags":["Hate Speech","Social Media","Recommender Systems"],"title":"OHARS","type":"project"}]
