Besides fostering social connections between persons, social networks also represent the ideal environment for undesirable phenomena, such as the dissemination of unwanted or aggressive content, misinformation and fake news, which all affect the individuals as well as the society as a whole. Thereby, in the last few years, the research on misinformation has received increasing attention. Nonetheless, even though some computational solutions have been presented, the lack of a common ground and public datasets has become one of the major barriers. Not only datasets are rare, but also, they are mostly limited to only the actual shared text, neglecting the importance of other features, such as social content and temporal information. In this scenario, this project proposes the creation of a publicly available dataset, comprising multi-sourced data and including diverse features related not only to the textual and multimedia content, but also to the social context of news and their temporal information. This dataset would not only allow tackling the task of fake news detection, but also studying their evolution, which, in turn, can foster the development of mitigation and debunking techniques.\nThe Figure shows the diffent types of data that can be retrived using Faking It!.\nIn summary, Faking It! allows to collect:\n Web content retrieved from urls given as input. Social posts referring to the selected news. Temporal diffusion of posts trajectory (for example, retweet or replies chains). URL and images accompanying the retrieved posts. For each user engaged in the diffusion process, the profile, posts and social network.  The original aim of the tool was collecting datasets related to the evolution and propagation of fake news. In this context, the collected multi-source datasets have the potential to contribute in the study of various open research problems related to fake news. The augmented set of features provides a unique opportunity to play with different techniques for detecting and analysing the evolution of fake news. Moreover, the temporal information enables the study of the processes of fake news diffusion and evolution, and the roles that users play in such processes through social media reactions. The proposed dataset could be the starting point of diverse exploratory studies and potential applications:\n  Fake news detection. One of the main difficulties is the lack of reliable labelled data and an extended feature set. The presented dataset aims at providing reliable labels annotated by humans and multi-sourced features including text, images, social context and temporal information.\n  Fake news evolution and engagement cycle. The diffusion process involves different stages in users’ engagement and reaction. Using the temporal information could help to study how stories become viral and their diffusion trajectories across social media. This would also allow to study the roles that users play on the diffusion.\n  Fake and malicious account detection. These types of accounts include social bots, trolls and spammers, which can all boost the spread of fake news. The user features in the dataset would allow studying the characteristics of such type of users, how they differentiate from legitimate users and how they contribute to the spread of disinformation.\n  Fake news debunking. Knowing the evolution and trajectories of fake news could help in the study of the debunking process. Likewise, user reactions and answers in social media can provide useful elements to help to determine the veracity of a piece of news.\n  ","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"4631cf3d8e3e6c88a3f44f5d621f2063","permalink":"https://tommantonela.github.io/software_project/fakingit/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software_project/fakingit/","section":"software_project","summary":"This Java tool aims at facilitating the creation of datasets from social media including not only the shared content, but also the social context of the content.","tags":["Social Media","Misinformation","Content","Social Context"],"title":"Faking It!","type":"software_project"},{"authors":["Antonela Tommasel","Daniela Godoy","Andres Diaz Pace"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"3741ca2db7eaebfe3a297129aca81cdc","permalink":"https://tommantonela.github.io/publication/2020ejs/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020ejs/","section":"publication","summary":"El objeto de estudio de este trabajo es la Provincia de Buenos Aires en Argentina, la cual concentra la mayor cantidad de ciudadanos del pais, y por lo tanto presenta la mayor necesidad de comunicacion con ellos.","tags":["Ciudadanos Digitales","Medios Sociales","e-Participacion","Gobiernos Locales","Gobierno Abierto"],"title":"Towards an effective e-Participation: an analysis of the interaction and engagement of Argentine digital citizens","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonela Tommasel"],"categories":[],"content":"Welcome to my new site!

Architectural smells are typical symptoms of such problems, and several of these smells are related to undesired dependencies among modules. The early detection of these smells is important for developers, so they can plan ahead for maintenance or refactoring efforts, thus preventing system degradation. Social Network Analysis (SNA) refers to a strategy for investigating social structures using network and graph theories. The link prediction problem adapts SNA techniques for studying to what extent the evolution of a network can be modelled by using features intrinsic to the network. Since the module structure can be regarded as a network, i.e., a dependency graph, we can leverage on network features to analyse the dynamics of such structure. In this talk, we will explore how link prediction and machine learning techniques could help anticipate architectural smells in future system versions. We will start with the basics of predicting future dependencies, up to the application of time forecasting and machine learning models for predicting the appearance of new architectural smells. Particularly, we will focus on two well-known dependency-related smells, cyclic dependencies and hub-like dependency. Finally, we will discuss some open issues and potential extensions.\n ","date":1570024800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570024800,"objectID":"10938f40bcaf017ea72c782f9f206c23","permalink":"https://tommantonela.github.io/talk/london2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-02T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/london2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Architectural Smells \u0026 Machine Learning mash-up","tags":["Machine Learning","Software Architecture","Architectural Smells"],"title":"Keeping one-step ahead of Architectural Smells: A Machine Learning application","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Awarded by Facebook as part of the \u0026ldquo;Content Policy Research on Social Media Platforms request for proposals\u0026rdquo; .\nPI: Antonela Tommasel\nCollaborators (in alphabetical order):\n Daniela Godoy - ISISTAN, CONICET-UNICEN, Argentina Aiqi Jiang - Queen Mary University of London, UK Arkaitz Zubiaga - Queen Mary University of London, UK  An important goal for hate speech detection techniques is to ensure that they are not unduly biased towards or against particular norms of offence. Training data is usually obtained by manually annotating a set of texts. Thereby, the reliability of human annotations is essential. Meanwhile, the ability to let big data \u0026ldquo;speak for itself\u0026rdquo; has been questioned as its representativeness, spatiotemporal extent and uneven demographic information can make it subjective.

The development of digital technologies, the expansion of the Internet and the growth of social networks have generated profound changes in political forms at a global level, modifying the bases of citizen participation. These new technologies have been established as a new way to channel and facilitate citizen participation in a given territory, offering new communication tools with government entities and their authorities. EParticipation involves the use of the information and communication technologies, mainly Internet, as the means of participation in democratic and consultative social processes. The goal of eParticipation is to support active citizenship with the latest technological developments, increasing access and the possibility of participating, and promoting a government that is open and close to citizens. Considering that democratic systems favour the interests of large groups of citizens, the more voices supporting a political proposal, the greater their chances of success. However, achieving effective citizen participation is a challenge, given that the simple fact of having access to online services does not imply the willingness of citizens to participate. In this context, social media sites could have a preponderant role in terms of citizen participation, making individuals not only feel that they have access to the information directly and permanently, but also the right to be involved in the public discourse and decisions. Consequently, it is necessary to carry out studies for determining the current status and perspectives of citizen participation in the context of social media. Thereby, this project aims to study and characterize the relationship between digital citizens and government entities in social media, in the context of eParticipation, to enable the definition of practices and strategies that lead to the efficient use of social media for communication between public institutions and citizens.\n","date":1567728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567728000,"objectID":"0572368d41fd1e63c346bbbe7b3b047b","permalink":"https://tommantonela.github.io/project/digital-citizenship/","publishdate":"2019-09-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/digital-citizenship/","section":"project","summary":"The Role of Social Media in e-Participation in Argentina","tags":["eGovernment","Citizens","Smart Cities","Social Media"],"title":"Digital Citizens","type":"project"},{"authors":["Antonela Tommasel","Daniela Godoy","Andres Diaz Pace"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"6be3f342ae26668b2f93924eaddb706f","permalink":"https://tommantonela.github.io/publication/2019sts/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019sts/","section":"publication","summary":"El objeto de estudio de este trabajo es la Provincia de Buenos Aires en Argentina, la cual concentra la mayor cantidad de ciudadanos del pais, y por lo tanto presenta la mayor necesidad de comunicacion con ellos.","tags":["Ciudadanos Digitales","Medios Sociales","e-Participacion","Gobiernos Locales","Gobierno Abierto"],"title":"Ciudadanos Digitales: explorando el rol de los medios sociales de comunicacion en la e-Participacion","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Sen4Smells is tool for prioritizing architecture-sensitive smells based on a technical debt index (e.g., ADI, SDI, etc.) Sen4Smells is licenced under the Apache License V2.0.\nThe main functionality of the Sen4Smells is providing assistence to engineers for interpretating Technical Debt metrics in terms problematic Architectural Smells and system packages.\nSen4Smells is able to perform a sensitivity analysis for a collection of system values provided by a predetermined debt index.

The inputs for this analysis are: a set of previous system versions, the formula for computing a particular Technical Debt, and the granularity level for the variables (e.g., smell types, individual smells, or packages).\nThe tool is designed as pipeline, in which existing modules for detecting smells and computing metrics from the source code can be configured.

Thereby, in the last few years, the research on misinformation has received increasing attention. Nonetheless, even though some computational solutions have been presented, the lack of a common ground and public datasets has become one of the major barriers. Not only datasets are rare, but also, they are mostly limited to only the actual shared text, neglecting the importance of other features, such as social content and temporal information. In this scenario, this project proposes the creation of a publicly available dataset, comprising multi-sourced data and including diverse features related not only to the textual and multimedia content, but also to the social context of news and their temporal information. This dataset would not only allow tackling the task of fake news detection, but also studying their evolution, which, in turn, can foster the development of mitigation and debunking techniques.\n","date":1566864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566864000,"objectID":"34337dccfe11827ac7b26bd735d26aec","permalink":"https://tommantonela.github.io/project/faking-it/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/faking-it/","section":"project","summary":"Faking It!

Architectural smells are typical symptoms of such problems, and several of these smells are related to undesired dependencies among modules. The early detection of these smells is important for developers, so they can plan ahead for maintenance or refactoring efforts, thus preventing system degradation. Social Network Analysis (SNA) refers to a strategy for investigating social structures using network and graph theories. The link prediction problem adapts SNA techniques for studying to what extent the evolution of a network can be modelled by using features intrinsic to the network. Since the module structure can be regarded as a network, i.e., a dependency graph, we can leverage on network features to analyse the dynamics of such structure. In this talk, we will explore how link prediction and machine learning techniques could help anticipate architectural smells in future system versions. We will start with the basics of predicting future dependencies, up to the application of time forecasting and machine learning models for predicting the appearance of new architectural smells.

The continuous growing and pervasive use of social media offers interesting research opportunities for analysing the behaviour and interactions of users. Nowadays, interactions are not only limited to social relations, but also to reading and writing activities. Thus, multiple and complementary information sources are available for characterising users and their activities. One task that could benefit from the integration of those multiple sources is community detection. However, most techniques disregard the effect of information aggregation and continue to focus only on one aspect: the topological structure of networks. This paper focuses on how to integrate social and content-based information originated in social networks for improving the quality of the detected communities. A technique for integrating both the multiple information sources and the semantics conveyed by asymmetric relations is proposed and extensively evaluated on two real-world datasets. Experimental evaluation confirmed the differentiated impact that each information source has on the quality of the detected communities, and shed some light on how to improve such quality by combining both social and content-based information.","tags":["Community Detection","Social Networks","Multi-view Learning","Social Graph","Community Structure"],"title":"Multi-view community detection with heterogeneous information from social media data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Manuel Rodriguez","Alejandro Zunino","Antonela Tommasel","Cristian Mateos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"c751af153f4c9718a0da15ecdbc2f368","permalink":"https://tommantonela.github.io/publication/2018igi/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018igi/","section":"publication","summary":"This chapter aims at predicting mobile devices' battery charge, whether it is plugged to A/C, and screen and WiFi state.","tags":[],"title":"Recurrent Neural Networks for Predicting Mobile Device State","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonela Tommasel","Juan Manuel Rodriguez","Daniela Godoy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"dfd21507e02c0d0f81095de2262f7839","permalink":"https://tommantonela.github.io/publication/2018coling/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018coling/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents the Isistanitos's approach for detecting aggressive content in multiple social media sites.","tags":[],"title":"Textual aggression detection through deep learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonela Tommasel","Daniela Godoy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"88bd2d9ef06a00e4a3e18dcbd90cd1c9","permalink":"https://tommantonela.github.io/publication/2017clei/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017clei/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper aims at providing some insights on how to integrate the multiple and heterogeneous social media information sources characterising user activities and behaviour to optimise the quality of found communities.

media platforms to recommend content to its users through features such as �whom to follow� or personalised content. It has been shown however that social media platforms also spread harmful contents that have proven problematic. This project aims to detect and mitigate content flagged as online harm, which includes hate speech and misinformation. These problematic issues in social media have led to mental health issues owing to hate speech messages, as well as a disruption of the democratic system due to the diffusion of misinformation. Identification of harmful content online has however proven difficult, with not only the scientific community but also social media platforms and governments worldwide calling for support to develop effective methods.\nThis project aims to develop novel recommendation algorithms for social media that prevent the amplification of online harms including misinformation and hate speech. Sources that are likely to generate this sort of online harm will be identified and will be flagged prior to making decisions with the recommender system. The algorithms will need to consider three main aspects: (1) detection of misinformation and abusive language from a multilingual perspective, for English and Spanish (2) incorporation of the notion of content toxicity, and accounts that promote it, into the inner components of recommendation algorithms (3) definition of mechanisms to counteract user exposure to online harm, such as the addition of features (such as provenance and context of information) that will increase user-awareness and help foster an informed decision making. The algorithms will also need to prevent potential biases inherent to traditional recommender systems, such as popularity and homogeneity.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3c4acec2c8574251aa414e8fcac5df86","permalink":"https://tommantonela.github.io/project/royal-society/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/royal-society/","section":"project","summary":"Online Harm-Aware Recommender System","tags":["Hate Speech","Social Media","Recommender Systems"],"title":"OHARS","type":"project"}]
